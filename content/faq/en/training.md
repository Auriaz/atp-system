## For coaches

1. Log in to your coach account

3. Click the "New Plan" button
4. Enter basic information about the plan:
   - Plan name
   - Description and goals
   - Duration (in weeks)
   - Skill level
5. Add training sessions for each day of the plan:
   - Select a day from the calendar
   - Click "Add Workout"
   - Choose exercises from the library or create your own
   - Specify sets, repetitions, and load
6. Save the plan by clicking "Save Plan"

Your plan is now ready to be assigned to athletes or shared publicly.
