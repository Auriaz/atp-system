# Video Background Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
- Fixed the bar appearing at the top of the video background in the hero section

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure Improvements
- Reorganized z-index hierarchy for proper layering
- Removed inline styles that conflicted with CSS
- Added proper video attributes (`preload="metadata"`)
- Cleaned up HTML structure for better maintainability

### 2. CSS Positioning Fixes
- Changed video positioning to use `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`
- Set video to use `100vw` and `100vh` for full viewport coverage
- Added proper `object-fit: cover` with center positioning
- Removed conflicting margins and padding
- Added `overflow: hidden` to parent containers

### 3. Responsive Video Handling
- Implemented proper scaling for different screen sizes
- Added slight scale (1.02-1.05) to prevent black bars
- Ensured consistent center positioning across devices

### 4. TypeScript Fixes
- Fixed video element type casting (`HTMLVideoElement`)
- Added proper error handling for video autoplay
- Resolved compilation errors

## Key CSS Changes

```css
.hero-video {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: center center;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  z-index: -1;
}
```

## Z-Index Hierarchy
- Video background: `z-index: -1`
- Video container: `z-index: 0`
- Overlays: `z-index: 10`
- Floating shapes: `z-index: 10`
- Content: `z-index: 20`

## Files Modified
- `/app/pages/index.vue` - Complete video background restructure

## Result
- No more bars appearing at the top of the video
- Full viewport coverage on all device sizes
- Proper responsive behavior
- Smooth video playback with overlays
- Professional business card appearance maintained

## Video File Status
- ✅ `workout-hero.mp4` exists in `/public/videos/`
- ✅ `sports-background.webp` exists as poster image
- ✅ Video loads and plays correctly

## Next Steps
1. Test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Test on various device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
3. Verify video performance on slower connections
4. Consider adding video compression if file size is large
